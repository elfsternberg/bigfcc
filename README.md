## Status

**August 4, 2011**: This project is **conditionally completed**.  No new
features are being considered.  If I'm called upon to code more C++ in
the future, I may amend it to generate
[Rule of 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming))
compliant code.  Someday.  Maybe.
