[1mNAME[0m
       fcc  is a tool to rapidly generate the basic framework of C++ class and
       components. fcc can generate  inline  files,  testing  components,  and
       basic copyright notices.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       fcc takes the name of one or more classes and generates the appropriate
       code and header files for those classes. By default, it includes a con-
       structor, destructor,  private  copy  constructor,  private  assignment
       operator,  unit  testing,  and appropriate inlines. It also generates a
       raw BSD-style makefile.

               Names of classes to be generated. The files will be named after
              the  first class name on the list. Class names must be separated
              by whitespace.

               Do not generate unit-testing definitions in the  source  files.
              This is an empty method; it's up to the user to define appropri-
              ate tests.

       [1m-no_makefile[0m
